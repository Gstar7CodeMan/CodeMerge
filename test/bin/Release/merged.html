A second astronaut, 	Soichi Noguchi, will be spacewalking at the same time, but he will be working 	on other tasks.</P><P>The removal of the gap fillers is being added to the list of tasks set out for 	the spacewalk, during which Robinson and Noguchi will also install an external 	storage platform to the space station.</P><P>Robinson's assignment <span style="text-decoration: line-through; color: red">will</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through; color: red">mark</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through; color: red">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through; color: red">first</span> time NASA has ever tried to repair the 	exterior of a shuttle in orbit, a capability developed in the wake of the 2003 	Columbia disaster.</P><P>The Columbia shuttle disintegrated over Texas, killing all seven crew members, 	as it returned from space.</P><A name="1"></A><A name="rv1"></A><H3>Risky job</H3><P>Andy Thomas, another member <span style="background: SpringGreen">Discovery</span> of the Discovery crew, acknowledged that the crew 	had initial "misgivings" about the repair, scheduled to take place during 	Wednesday's scheduled spacewalk.</P><P>"We were concerned about the implications of it and what was motivating it," he 	said.

"This situation, I believe, will 	certainly be safer for entry.

"If we can't prove that it's safe, then 	we don't want to go there."</P><P>President Bush called the crew Tuesday and expressed his support for the mission 	and the space program.</P><P>He thanked the astronauts for being "risk takers for the sake of exploration."</P><P>"We look forward to <span style="background: SpringGreen">the</span> <span style="background: SpringGreen">successful</span> <span style="background: SpringGreen">completion</span> the successful completion of this mission," he said. (<A href="/2005/US/08/02/bush.discovery.ap/index.html">Full 		story</A>)</P><P>The protruding gap fillers were discovered during an extensive inspection of 	Discovery's exterior, carried out by cameras and lasers on a new boom on the 	space shuttle. The crew of the space station also photographed the underbelly 	of the shuttle before it<span style="text-decoration: line-through; color: red">docked</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through; color: red">last</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through; color: red">Thursday</span>, part of a new inspection regime 	put in place after the Columbia disaster.</P><P>Hale said NASA managers are satisfied that appropriate safeguards are in place 	to prevent Robinson from damaging the tiles during the repair operation, which 	could make Discovery's re-entry even more <span style="background: SpringGreen">Discovery's</span> <span style="background: SpringGreen">re-entry</span> problematic.</P><P>Calculations by NASA experts showed that the protrusions could increase the 	re-entry temperature by 10 percent to 30 percent, possibly exceeding NASA's 	safety guidelines for how much heat the shuttle's thermal protection system 	should be allowed to endure, Hale said.</P><P>While the protrusions might not pose any threat to Discovery, the "large 	uncertainty" about their possible effect on the aerodynamics of the shuttle 	convinced NASA <span style="text-decoration: line-through; color: red">officials</span> <span style="background: SpringGreen">oddice</span> to try to fix the problem in space, he said.</P><P>Hale said there is no data to show whether previous shuttle missions have 	managed to return safely with similar protrusions. While extended gap fillers 	have <span style="background: SpringGreen">has</span> <span style="background: SpringGreen">been</span> been found before, they were only discovered after landing, leaving NASA 	experts with no way to know whether the material shifted before or after 	re-entry.</P><P>Discovery can return safely without either of the gap fillers in place, Hale 	said. One of them keeps tiles from vibrating against each other during liftoff 	and has no purpose for re-entry;  <span style="background: SpringGreen">asdgf</span> <span style="background: SpringGreen">asf</span> <span style="background: SpringGreen">asdf</span> <span style="background: SpringGreen">sadf</span> the other is designed to prevent repeated 	overheating of a gap between two tiles, but not having it in place during a 	single re-entry would still be "well <span style="background: SpringGreen">sdg</span> <span style="background: SpringGreen">asdf</span>  within our safety margins," Hale said.</P><P>On Monday, Robinson and  <span style="background: SpringGreen">asg</span> <span style="background: SpringGreen">asdgf</span> Noguchi completed their second spacewalk of the mission, 	during which they replaced a <span style="text-decoration: line-through; color: red">faulty</span> <span style="background: SpringGreen">faultasdg</span> <span style="background: SpringGreen">sadg</span> <span style="background: SpringGreen">y</span> gyroscope on the space station.</P><DIV class="cnnStoryContrib">	<P>Copyright 2005 CNN.
